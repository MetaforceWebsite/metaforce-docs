# Projects

Metaforce Project is a lightweight and powerful code editor for salesforce development.  
Compared to VS Code, `Metaforce Code Editor` has a user friendly interface and provides many handy actions, like code comparison, test execution, etc.

## Create Apex/Aura/LWC/Object/Field

Metaforce project provides quick actions to create following resources easily:

1. Visualforce page
2. Apex Class
3. Apex Trigger
4. Aura Component
5. LWC Component
6. New CustomObject, CustomSetting, Custom Metadata Object

## Package XML Builder

In salesforce, a `package.xml` file defines the components that youâ€™re trying to retrieve or deploy.  
Here is a simple package xml file:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
        <types>
            <members>MyCustomObject__c</members>
            <name>CustomObject</name>
        </types>
        <types>
            <members>*</members>
            <name>CustomTab</name>
        </types>
        <types>
            <members>Standard</members>
            <name>Profile</name>
        </types>
        <version>58.0</version>
    </Package>

To build/update a package xml, you can use `Package XML Builder` to quickly choose components and save/export as a package xml file.

## package.xml

The `package.xml` is a xml file which include metadata types and metadata components. It can be used to retrieve metadata from your salesforce org.
Metaforce project also use package.xml to retrieve metadata components under the project. It's auto created by default when you add the project.

> Notes: the usage of `package.xml` is totally same with the `package.xml`.

-   The package.xml file is `auto generated` while you create a new project.
-   The package.xml file can be `updated via Package XML Builder`.
-   The package.xml file can be `retrieved to refresh its all components`.

## Edit CustomObject Xml

Once custom objects are retrieved successfully, you can find them in project side bar. A specific custom object can be expanded as below:

-   `Folders`: fields, list views, validation rules, layouts, weblinks(Button & Links).
-   `xxxxxx.object`: a complete custom object metadata xml which includes all metadata definitions, includes fields, validations, buttons, etc.

### Refresh From Salesforce (Cmd + Shift + R)

### Run Apex Test

There are 2 ways to run an apex test class:

1. `Run Quick Test`: run apex test methods only without generating code coverage. It can be used to quickly validate if your test methods have any exception during execution.
2. `Run Test`: run apex test methods and generate code coverages.

> Tips: When writing apex test class, you can use "Run Quick Test" to test if all test methods can be executed successfully. Then, use "Run Test" to check if the code coverage is sufficient for the deployment.

### Show Apex Coverage

> Show apex coverage percentage and highlight covered code lines in code editor. Please always ensure your apex code coverage is great than 75% at least.

### Open In Salesforce (Cmd + Shift + O)

> Show apex coverage percentage and highlight covered code lines in code editor.

### Diff With Target Org

> See a diff between current apex code and the same apex in the target org you select.
